## Encapsulation
- Encapsulation is like making a car. If your function is to drive the car, you don't need to know which brake oil the car uses
   in essence, only the useful information is made available and the rest is hidden.
 - Here the class which I made `encaps.java` has two classes, a main class encaps and a getter class which will try to get all
   the variables in the encaps class but fails to do so as one of the class's variable is private to the encaps class and trying to get it results in the following error:

    But wwhen this line is removed, code runs peacefully:

## Polymorphism
- Polymorphism is used if the same function is to be have different uses and implementations like an area function can have uses for many polygons such 
  as for a rectangle it can be used with two parameters one asking for length and the other for breadth and for a circle we only need the radius.
  Output:

  both the values come from the same function, named `area` but used with different parameters.
  
## Inheritance
- The concept is derived from biology that child inherits some features from the parents, same here in java the child class inherits the features from the parent class
