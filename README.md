## Polymorphism
- Polymorphism is used if the same function is to be have different uses and implementations like an area function can have uses for many polygons such 
  as for a rectangle it can be used with two parameters one asking for length and the other for breadth and for a circle we only need the radius.
  Output:

  both the values come from the same function, named `area` but used with different parameters.
  
## Inheritance
- The concept is derived from biology that child inherits some features from the parents, same here in java the child class inherits the features from the parent class
